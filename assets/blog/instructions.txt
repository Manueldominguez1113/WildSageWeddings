Steps for Blog posts!

It's a 2 step process!!!

step 1:
upload blog posts in .txt format here, in this folder, on the cpanel!

Step 2:
update the list.json to include your file!

example(the list.json should look like this...):

[
    {
        "fileName":"name-of-blog-1.txt",
        "title":"First Blog!!!",
        "date":"11/14/2020"
    },
    {
        "fileName":"name-of-blog-2.txt",
        "title":"my second blog ever",
        "date":"11/15/2020"
    },
    {
        "fileName":"name-of-blog-3.txt",
        "title":"another post....",
        "date":"11/16/2020"
    }
]


you can continue to add files until you run out of storage space on the website!
just make sure of 4 things in the list.json:

1. the entire list of blog posts are contained within ONE []
2. each blog info is contained in a {}  and separated from the next post by a ,
3. make sure there is nothing in between the [] and the FIRST and LAST {} entry in the list(notice in example the start is [{ and the end is }])
4. in FileName, please put the exact name of the file, and when naming files in general: try not to use spaces, / or \ in filenames("my blog/1" is a no go!)

extra tip:  make sure to not duplicate file names in your list. this will not cause any critical errors, but you will link to the same file twice, which you could expect it mess up the webpage a bit until resolved.

extra-extra tip: the spacing in the list.json DOES NOT MATTER! it's only spaced in such a way to be easier to read and add new posts!

Also good to know: I reversed it's order, so now as you add posts under the previous entry in the list, the website will understand and post your latest entries to the front of the page, and push your older posts back!

you can copy this to append a new post to the list, if this is the first post, remember to not use the , on the next line!:
    ,
    {
        "fileName":"name-of-blog.txt",
        "title":"anything goes here!",
        "date":"11/16/2020 or may 20, 2023 or even 2023-11-12"
    }
